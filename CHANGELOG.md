## 🎉 Preliminarily establish the project framework.

## 🎯 Features

- A relatively complete software engineering project structure, including directories for [code](https://github.com/Ahzyuan/Python-package-template/tree/v1.0.0/package-name), [test](https://github.com/Ahzyuan/Python-package-template/tree/v1.0.0/tests), [document](https://github.com/Ahzyuan/Python-package-template/tree/v1.0.0/docs), and [project demonstration](https://github.com/Ahzyuan/Python-package-template/tree/v1.0.0/examples)

- `setup.py` is a collection of useful patterns and best practices. It extends the `python setup.py` command to achieve one-step code updates, package builds, and releases to [PyPi](https://pypi.org/) using `Twine`.
